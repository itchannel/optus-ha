# Optus Mobile Home Assistant Integration

## Install
Use HACS and add as a custom repo. Once the integration is installed go to your integrations and follow the configuration options to specify the below:
- Username (Optus Mobile App)
- Password (Optus Mobile App)

## Usage
You must have an Optus mobile account. Integration is still very much in Beta so there will be bugs and as the API isn't officially support by Optus it may break on changes.
